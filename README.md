# roommateTasks

## Overview

**roommateTasks** is a mobile application developed using Expo and React Native, designed to help roommates manage shared responsibilities and tasks. The app offers features such as:

- Task assignment and tracking
- Notifications for upcoming chores or events
- A shared calendar for scheduling communal activities

## Development Status

As of now, the development of roommateTasks has been paused. The project has encountered performance issues, including significant system resource consumption, leading to instability on my development machine. Consequently, I am not actively developing or maintaining this project at this time.
